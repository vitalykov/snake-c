# snake-c
Trying to make a Snake game using only basic C language features and syscalls to the OS kernel

## Build and run
```
make snake    # build an executable in build/ directory
make run      # run the game
make clean    # clean the build folder
make rebuild  # rebuild the executable in build/ directory
```
