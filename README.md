# snake-c
Trying to make a Snake game using only basic C language features and syscalls to the OS kernel

## Build and run
You can build an executable in build/ directory using
```bash
make snake
```
Then the game could be launch with
```bash
make run
```
To remove installed files:
```bash
make clean
```
If you want to rebuild game use
```bash
make rebuild
```
